# Understanding Address Types of Different Blockchains

To identify which blockchain a cryptocurrency address belongs to, you typically need to examine the address format and any prefix or characteristics unique to that blockchain. Here's how you can do it for some of the most common blockchains:

1. **Bitcoin (BTC)**:
   - Bitcoin addresses typically start with a '1' (for legacy addresses) or 'bc1' (for Segregated Witness or Bech32 addresses).
   - Addresses that start with '3' are also valid, representing P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) addresses.
   - Addresses starting with '2' are used in rare cases for Testnet.

2. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**:
   - Bitcoin Cash addresses often look very similar to Bitcoin addresses.
   - They start with a 'q' for legacy addresses or 'bitcoincash:' for CashAddr addresses.

3. **Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum-based Tokens**:
   - Ethereum addresses are hexadecimal and usually start with '0x.'
   - Tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as ERC-20 tokens, also use Ethereum addresses for receiving tokens.

4. **Litecoin (LTC)**:
   - Litecoin addresses start with an 'L' for legacy addresses or 'M' for Segregated Witness addresses (addresses that start with '3' are not used in Litecoin).

5. **Ripple (XRP)**:
   - Ripple addresses consist of a combination of numbers and letters.
   - They typically start with an uppercase 'R' or lowercase 'r.'

6. **Cardano (ADA)**:
   - Cardano addresses consist of a long string of alphanumeric characters.
   - Addresses start with 'addr' for mainnet addresses and 'addr_test' for testnet addresses.

7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**:
   - Binance Coin addresses start with 'bnb' and are followed by a series of alphanumeric characters.

8. **Chainlink (LINK)**:
   - Chainlink addresses, like Ethereum-based tokens, start with '0x.'

9. **Stellar (XLM)**:
   - Stellar addresses start with a lowercase 'g' followed by a string of alphanumeric characters.

10. **Tezos (XTZ)**:
    - Tezos addresses start with 'tz' and are followed by alphanumeric characters.

It's essential to verify the address format and prefix when identifying the blockchain associated with an address. Additionally, it's always a good practice to double-check the documentation or specifications for the specific cryptocurrency you are dealing with, as address formats may evolve over time. Using incorrect addresses could result in the loss of funds, so accuracy is crucial when working with cryptocurrency addresses.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
